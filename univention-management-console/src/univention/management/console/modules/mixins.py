Mixins for UMC module classes
=============================

This module provides some mixins that can be incorporated in existing UMC
modules. These mixins extend the functionality of the module in an easy-to-use
way. Just let your module derive from
:class:`~univention.management.console.module.Base` (as before) and the mixin
classes.
