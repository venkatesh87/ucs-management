# All entries have the form:
#   <module> <name> <directoryPath> <templateFile>
# Then, the actual loaded report template file depends on the language (which
# is determined automatically) and is given as: 
#   <directoryPath>/<language>/<templateFile>
# where <language> corresponds to, e.g., "de_DE" or "en_US".
#
# In case no language directory can be found, the template file is loaded as:
#   <directoryPath>/<templateFile>
# For LaTeX reports, it is expected that the two files "header.tex" and 
# "footer.tex" exist in the same directory as the template file itself.
#
# In case header/footer files cannot be found, the deprecated entries 'header'
# and 'footer' will be used (see above). This behaviour is for compatibility
# reasons. Also due to compatibility reasons, the old format is accepted:
#   <module> <name> <templateFilePath>
