=== Build ===

In order to build the UMC application, call 'make build'. This will start the
Dojo build process and will create a compressed JavaScript file that contains
all main modules used in the code (build/dojo/dojo.js). All other modules still
exist as separate module files which are also compressed. The build process
will create a new subdirectory 'build' to which all necessary files are store.


=== Development ===

The Dojo build process takes some time. In order to develop, call "make
build-dev" to shorten the build process. The directory tmp is then created and
updated. Herein, JavaScript and stylus files are symbolic links to their
sources. The tmp directory can be hooked into /var/www via a symbolic link.
Since all of the files are simply symbolic links to the original source files,
they can be modified directly in order to perform 'live' development.

Stylus files need to compiled to CSS files, nevertheless. Simply run "make
build-dev" to recompile only CSS files.


=== Debugging ===

Debugging in JavaScript can be somewhat cumbersome since modules are loaded 
dynamically by Dojo. Error messages thus do not have useful tracebacks (they
point to the position where the file was dynamically loaded). Working with a
release build, one may change the included file '.../dojo/dojo.js' to 
'.../dojo/dojo.js.uncompressed.js'. This will load the uncompressed version
of the build file (which contains all main modules). Tracebacks within modules
contained in this file can be correctly traced back.
