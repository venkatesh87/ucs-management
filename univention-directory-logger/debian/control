Description: UCS - Directory Logger
 UCS Directory Logger is a module for the UCS Directory Listener
 that logs changes to the UCS LDAP Directory as protocol records to a log file.
 Each record reports the timestamp and kind of the modification along with
 the authentification ID (LDAP DN) of the initiator of a modification. The
 changed attributes are reported as well. Each record contains the hash value
 of the previous record to build up a chain of trusted records.
 The hash value of each new generated record is sent to the syslog where it may
 be directed to remote hosts to allow independent auditing.
 .
 This package is part of Univention Corporate Server (UCS),
 an integrated, directory driven solution for managing
 corporate environments. For more information about UCS,
